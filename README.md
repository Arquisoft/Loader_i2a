## Setup
As our code uses MongoDB although we have created an online instance at [mlab] (https://mlab.com/) the user will not have to install nothing related to it. We can say that the program is close to be ready to use, the only thin that will be needed is to download/install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

## How to download and install Maven
### Windows
Download Maven (binary zip archive format) from the following [link] (https://maven.apache.org/).

Once you have downloaded it, create a folder named "maven" in "C:\" this is a safe place of your computer and ensures you will not remove the files containing maven accidentally, after you will have to extract the downloaded zip into the "maven" folder created. 

The next process will be to add Maven your Path variable, in order to do this go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system configuration. Click on Environment Variables, and edit select Path on User variables and click edit, once you are in the next screen click new and copy the root to the bin folder inside apache-maven-x.x.x (been x.x.x the version installed) for example this was the root in my case "C:\maven\apache-maven-3.5.2\bin", finally save before exiting.

### Linux
Installing Maven in Linux is easy and straightforward, you will just have to type the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install maven
```
